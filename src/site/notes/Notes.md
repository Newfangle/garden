Hi, my name's Brendan. We don't know each other but I'm hoping to get to interview you for a research project I'm working on because of the work you do.

I'm researching and writing for a concept of equitable, empowering co-op housing ran for and by people with disabilities, both out of interest in collaboration with friends in forming one, and in sharing the research and models we create. 

A little about me, I've been involved in community organizing and activism mostly in Southern California for about 7 years, such as Food Not Bombs, a radical community center, houseless and squatters rights, land defense, etc. 

I've also been the primary caregiver for my best friend for 5 years, who has a debilitating physical condition and has been unhoused most of that time. I have several other rad friends who I've discussed these ideas with, several with their own disabilities.

If you're open I'd be excited to ask you some questions, and possibly include parts of the interview in the finished product. Please share any questions you have, hope to hear from you. Thanks for the work you do.

-Brendan Hutchinson

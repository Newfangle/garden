-Breaking away from the normalized scarcity that society and government impose on people with disabilities such as in limiting, incompatible, or abusive group homes or family homes, or houselessness– and forming empowerment via co-operation 

-Map from scarcity model, where co-op members can collaborate with a minimum of resources to improve their standard of living, to growth model, where co-op members can surpass scarcity and aspirations and imagination can replace bare minimums.

Scarcity Model:
-Imagine that this many people with no other income than SSI find co-op living more empowering than their current living situation. Combining these SSI’s, what kind of building could be rented or purchased in different example locations based on current prices? 
-Explore how you can collaborate on and seek community support for fundraisers.

Growth Model:
-Once the co-op exists, can grants be applied for (research grants), growing the co-op’s financial stability out of the scarcity model?
-The co-op can create jobs in the community– each member can have up to five caregivers assigned to them, depending on their amount of IHSS hours (cite)
-Once stable, the co-op can mirror its humanizing principles and empowering action back into the community, facilitating or hosting space for causes related to disability and many other intersectional causes like social, racial, environmental justice.
-Co-ops with sufficient space and willing memberships can take this further and form athenaeums (cite), providing much needed ‘third space’ for continuous activism, education, conversation, celebration.
-Empowered co-ops can choose to take on the work of encouraging the formation of more co-ops. 
-Co-ops can network and support each other, and can collectively share disability resources and tools in a library system based on need.

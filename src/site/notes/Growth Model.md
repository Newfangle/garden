Growth Model:
-Once the co-op exists, can grants be applied for (research grants), growing the co-op’s financial stability out of the scarcity model?
-The co-op can create jobs in the community– each member can have up to five caregivers assigned to them, depending on their amount of IHSS hours (cite)
-Once stable, the co-op can mirror its humanizing principles and empowering action back into the community, facilitating or hosting space for causes related to disability and many other intersectional causes like social, racial, environmental justice.
-Co-ops can network and support each other, and can collectively share disability resources and tools in a library system based on usufruct, need in the wider community.
-Co-ops with sufficient space and willing memberships can take this further and form athenaeums (cite), providing much needed ‘third space’ for continuous activism, education, conversation, celebration.
-Empowered co-ops can choose to take on the work of encouraging the formation of more co-ops.

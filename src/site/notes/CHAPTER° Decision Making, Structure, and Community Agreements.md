Advocate for horizontal consensus decision making between those most affected by the co-op, starting with the members and potentially extending to the caregivers and relevant community. The idea being the members are always making the decisions of what is best for themselves– why would this ever be given away to a separate power structure? Liquid democracy model – vote delegation is possible to opt into but is always recallable.
